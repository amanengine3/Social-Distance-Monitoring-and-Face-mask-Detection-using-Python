# Social-Distance-Monitoring-and-Face-mask-Detection-using-Python
In this we have Python to Monitor Social Distancing in a Public Area, we have utilised python in conjunction with deep learning and computer vision to track social distancing and detecting mask in a public area.

About--
                  Social Distancing and Face Mask Detection Platform utilizes Artificial Network to perceive if a person walk with maintain social distance and does/doesn’t wear a mask as well. The application can be associated with any current or new IP cameras to identify individuals maintaining social distance with/without a mask. 😷
